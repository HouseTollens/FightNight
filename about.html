            <p>Hello Everyone Chris here! Let me tell you a little bit about myself,
               I am a 20 year old computer science student here at the University of Washington. I am half French and
               half Swedish. I really like to travel a lot, because I get to eat all sorts of good food. I chose
               Computer Science mainly for my interest in Artificial Intelligence and Artificial Life. I am an avid gamer
               so you can always find me playing something on my free time :D Thanks for taking the time to check out our game
               and I hope you enjoy!</p>
